# Layered Heightmap Terrain
Source code for the layered heightmap terrain generation used in SAS Battlefield.

- Showcase scene contains code used to visualize the combination of heightmap layers. Press space to start.
- Terrain scene contains just the terrain.

Map size can be changed in the Terrain Manager script.

I have no problem with anyone using this code for any purpose therefore there is no license attached :)
